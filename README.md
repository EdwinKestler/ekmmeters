#ekmmeters

A Python Serial API for EKM Omnimeters

The purpose of this library is to provide a reliable and flexible interface to EKM version 3 and version 4 Omnnimeters.  It is written to be compatible with existing EKM field naming conventions and to be accessible to both the casual user -- who may not know Python well and simply wishes to script his or her meter -- and the experienced user who is creating a device agent to manage a meter bank.

It is designed for Python 2.6 under CentOS 6.x, and Python 2.7x otherwise, including Iron Python on .NET.  The library is a single file and pure Python.  You can install with "pip ekmmeters" or use include the library file directly.

All calls except change meter number are provided, as are all constants for making meter settings and retrieving data.

The software is provided under an MIT License.  The MIT license allows you to use this library for any personal or commercial project, without an obligation to release any of your work as open source.
